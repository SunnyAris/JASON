## The JSON format is almost identical to JavaScript objects.

In JSON, keys must be strings, written with double quotes:

JSON
```
{"name":"John"}
```
In JavaScript, keys can be strings, numbers, or identifier names.
In JavaScript, you can write string values with double or single quotes:

JavaScript
```
{name:"John"}
```
```
{name:'John'}
```

In JSON, values must be one of the following data types:

- a string
- a number
- an object
- an array
- a boolean
- null


In JavaScript values can be all of the above, plus any other valid JavaScript expression, including:

- a function
- a date
- undefined
