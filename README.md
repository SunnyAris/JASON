# JSON
## What is JSON?


- JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation
- JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format
- JSON is plain text written in JavaScript object notation
- JSON is used to send data between computers
- JSON is language independent *


The JSON syntax is derived from JavaScript object notation, but the JSON format is text only.

Code for reading and generating JSON exists in many programming languages.


JSON Example
This example is a JSON string:
```
'{"name":"John", "age":30, "car":null}'
```
### It defines an object with 3 properties:
- name
- age
- car
Each property has a value.

### If you parse the JSON string with a JavaScript program, you can access the data as an object:
```
let personName = obj.name;
let personAge = obj.age;
```
